# whishlist
Whishlist uses Trello as a backend to display a whishlist on a simple public page (be careful who you send that link to, it's totally unsecure)

I have tried multiple times to get my family to look on the Trello board I had setup for when they ask for gift ideas. It was always difficult to get them to manage Trello, needs to login, share link doesn't always work the first time, etc...

The solution: a public url that displays the lists of a given board, as well as gifts that were already taken up for offering, so that you're sure to not get any duplicate gifts when your birthday comes.

The best part: using Trello you can send cards to the whishlist from another Trello board, this way you don't spoil the surprise.
